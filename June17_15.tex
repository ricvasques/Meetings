\begin{large}
\begin{itemize}
\item[1] General arrival logistics, setling in office, miscelanea
\item[2] Appointment paperwork - HR mess up, new search
\item[3] Research Project: Improving Hybrid Modeling with Angular Information
\item[4] Non-Classical and Levermore-Pomraning Research
\item[5] Teaching 
\end{itemize}
\end{large}

\noindent\textbf{1- General arrival logistics, setling in office, miscelanea}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] SAVIO account: Rachel sent an email to Krishna
\item[-] GITHUB: Richard will sign up, use Version Control for TeX documents
\item[-] BCal: calendar, schedules, etc.
\item[-] Richard will order a computer from Bearbuy
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{2- Appointment paperwork - HR mess up, new search}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] HR informed that a new search needs to take place
\item[-] Rachel has already started process for this
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{3- Research Project: Improving Hybrid Modeling with Angular Information}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Richard will study the methods/models/equations
\item[-] On the alert for possible improvements/insights in these models
\item[-] Richard now has access to Dropbox files
\item[-] Richard will work with Madicken in order to (i) get to use the codes; (ii) learn about details of project; (iii) assist Madicken in training for the oral exams
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{4- Non-Classical and Levermore-Pomraning Research}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Discussed current status for non-classical theory: boundary conditions (ICTT), diffusion (Physor), integral equation (Appl. Math Letters)
\item[-] Ideas to move forward with non-classical: Interface-free Monte Carlo; large data tallying; BWRs
\item[-] Maybe submit BWR idea to DOE request
\item[-] Levermore-Pomraning: moving forward; Scatter vs. Unscattered model; (Patrick Brantley ?)
\item[-] Maybe incoming students will be interested in projects
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{5- Teaching}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Help Rachel with upcoming Fall and Spring classes
\end{itemize}
